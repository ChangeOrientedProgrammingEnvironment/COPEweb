  Successful software constantly evolves: change is the heart of software development.
  We are a team of researchers committed to improving the lives of software developers by understanding the practice of code changes. We have a track record of using this understanding to develop tools that we contribute to the Eclipse and NetBeans development environments. Everybody in the COPE team is a strong believer in open-source. The COPE project is open-source and hosted by <a href="https://github.com/ChangeOrientedProgrammingEnvironment" target="_new" style="padding: 2px 4px; border: 1px solid grey"><img src="img/git_logo.png" height="20" style="margin: 1px"/>github</a>
  </p>

  <p>
  We have an ongoing study on understanding how developers change code when they follow Test Driven Development (TDD).     
  </p>

  <p>
  By participating in this study you can help to advance the state of the art. We will also send you a personalized report on how your development practices compare with the TDD practices of others.
