    <p>For all Java-developers who use IntelliJ IDEA to work on personal, class or open-source projects! You have a chance to make valuable scientific contribution without spending any intellectual effort!</p>

    <p>Group of researchers from Oregon State University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of Texas at Austin conduct study of TDD practices used by professional Java-developers in their everyday life and work. <a href="team.html">Researchers</a> need your help with beta-testing of plugin for IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Plugin has been developed by researchers to collect data about source code edits, runs of unit-tests and unit-test results performed in IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Plugin records information required for the study and sends data regularly to the server located at <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> for further analysis. If you donâ€™t need to worry about intellectual property of your source code, we invite you for beta-testing of the COPE plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

    <p>If you are Java-developer using IntelliJ IDEA and you expect to work on personal, class or open-source project in the near future, all you need to do is:
        <ol>
            <li>Accept <a href="opensource.html" target="_new">informed consent</a> form.</li>
            <li>Proceed with installation instructions of COPE plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.</li>
            <li>Fill in short questionnaire after you have successfully installed COPE plugin.</li>
            <li>Proceed with Java-development.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>If you encounter any errors, please report it using this <a href="error.html" target="_new">form</a>. You automatically become research participant once you install COPE plugin even if you do not get a chance to send error report. You can stop your participation in the study by uninstalling plugin (you can find uninstallation instructions <a href="install.html" target="_new">here</a>).</p>

    <p>If you need to receive study report after the study is complete, you will need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Participate in the study by keeping COPE Plugin installed until the end date of data collection phase.</li>
            <li>Provide your e-mail for the feedback as a part of questionnaire.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Personalized report will contain:
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed description of TDD practices you used over the course of data collection phase.</li>
            <li>Personalized statistics and metrics, calculated as a result of data analysis phase.</li>
            <li>Information about personal rating with regard to other study participants. Rating will be calculated based on established <a href="http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1066" target="_new">maturity criteria for TDD practices</a> used by every study participant.</li>
        </ul>
