	<b>Title of Research Study:</b> <u>Understanding TDD Practices</u>
</p>

<p>
<b>Purpose of Experiment: </b> We are a group of researchers at the EECS department at Oregon State University.  We are conducting a research project about Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. We will be recording code edits and test runs in order to understand how TDD developers make changes to their code.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Participants should:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>be a Java developer</li>
		<li>use TDD</li>
		<li>use Eclipse</li>
		<li>be over 18 years old</li>
	</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nature of the Experiment: </b>
	<p>In order to support your proprietary development, we will do a custom deployment such that all the data stays on your company servers. </p><p>
	
	With your approval and supervision, we will run automated tools that will identify trends in the data. We will then use only those trends.  This way we will avoid seeing your source code, while still incorporating the trends in our research.   We are also willing to sign an NDA at your request.  
	</p><p>
	We will make the resulting trends available to you so that you can analyze how your company practices compare with the state of the art.
	</p><p>
	Any data you give us we will keep for at least three years post study termination. The results of this study will be published in workshops, conferences, journals, and student dissertations.  However, your company's identity will never be disclosed in any publication.
	</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Compensation: </b> None
</p>

<p>
<b>Duration of the Experiment: </b> We will collect data for a period of no longer then 3 months
</p>

<p>
<b>Benefits of the Experiment: </b> The benefit to your company is that we will prepare a report that will allow you to analyze how your company practices compare with the state of the art.
</p>

<p>
<b>Potential Risks : </b>
<ol><li>Internet: The security and confidentiality of information collected from you online cannot be guaranteed. Information collected online can be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses.</li>
</ol>

</p>


<p>
<b>Voluntariness:</b> Participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without penalty. If you choose to withdraw from this project before it ends, the researchers may keep information collected about you and this information may be included in study reports. However, your company's identity will not be disclosed in any publication.
