	<b>Title of Research Study:</b> <u>Understanding TDD Practices</u>
</p>

<p>
In order to support your proprietary development, we will do a custom deployment such that all the data stays on your company servers. 
With your approval and supervision, we will run automated tools that will identify trends in the data. We will then use only those trends. This way we will avoid seeing your source code, while still incorporating the trends in our research. We are also willing to sign an NDA at your request. 
</p><p>
We will make the resulting trends available to you so that you can analyze how your company practices compare with the state of the art.
</p><p>
Any data you give us we will keep for at least three years post study termination. The results of this study will be published in workshops, conferences, journals, and student dissertations. However, your company's identity will never be disclosed in any publication.
