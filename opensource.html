	<b>Title of Research Study:</b> <u>Understanding TDD Practices</u>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Purpose of Experiment: </b> We are a group of researchers at the <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu">EECS department at Oregon State University</a>. We are conducting a research project about Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. We will be recording code edits and test runs in order to understand how TDD developers make changes to their code.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Participants: </b>
	You should:
	<ul>
		<li>be a Java developer</li>
		<li>use TDD</li>
		<li>use Eclipse</li>
		<li>be over 18 years old</li>
	</ul>
	If you are developing proprietary software or working on a company machine, then you cannot participate using this consent form.  We have a <a href="#companies" class="header_button">different consent process for working with proprietary software</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Nature of the Experiment:</b> We will be passively and unobtrusively recording code edits and test runs in order to understand how TDD developers make changes to their code. 
	<br />
	In order for the experiment to give us meaningful data, it is important that we be able to view your source code.  We will ask you for just a few pieces of demographic information.  We will prepare a report that describes TDD practices based on our study. If you choose to give us your email, we will send you a personalized version of the report so you can see how your practices compare to the rest of the anonymous participants. We know that spam is annoying, and we promise not to give out your email to anyone.  
	<br />
	We will keep the data for at least three years post study termination. The results of this study will be published in workshops, conferences, journals, and student dissertations.  However, your identity will never be disclosed in any publication.
</p>
<p>
<b>Compensation:</b> None
</p>

<p>
<b>Duration of the Experiment: </b> We will collect data for a period of no longer then 3 months
</p>

<p>
Benefits of the Experiment: 
This study offers no specific benefits to you, but to the software engineering community at large, by developing tools and techniques to improve TDD.

<b>Potential Risks:</b> 
<ul>
<li><b>Internet:</b> The security and confidentiality of information collected from you online cannot be guaranteed. Information collected online can be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Voluntariness:</b> Participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without penalty. If you choose to withdraw from this project before it ends, the researchers may keep information collected about you and this information may be included in study reports. However, your identity will not be disclosed in any publication.
